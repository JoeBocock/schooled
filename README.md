## About Schooled

Schooled is an example Laravel project that consumes school data and presents certain information about entities often found within a school. E.G. Classes, Students and Employees.

## Getting Started

Schooled uses Laravel Sail to power both the local environment as well as the GitHub workflows. To get up and running locally please follow the below steps. Please note that `docker` must be installed (along with Docker Compose V2).

As a final note, please make sure nothing is running on the common Sail ports. They can be found within the root level `docker-compose.yml`.

First, clone the repository and enter the directory.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:JoeBocock/schooled.git

cd schooled
```

<br>

Next, install the composer deps.
```sh
make install
```

<br>

Thirdly, copy the example env.
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

<br>

Then bring up sail.
```sh
make up
```

<br>

Next, generate the application key.
```sh
make key
```

<br>

Run the migrations.
```sh
make migrate
```

<br>

Install NPM packages.
```sh
make npm-install
```

<br>

Build the FE assets with vite
```sh
make vite-build
```

<br>

Optionally, you may seed the database with a test user.
```sh
# test@example.com & password
make seed
```

<br>

Finally, you should set your environment variables. See `{provider}_KEY` & `{provider}_SCHOOL_ID`.

Once you've completed the above steps, you should now have the Sail stack available locally and Schooled should be running on `localhost`. If you need to verify your email after registration, you may access `Mailpit` at `localhost:8025`.

## Extra Commands

There are a few other common commands that the makefile supports.

- `make test` will run the test suite.
- `make lint` will lint the codebase.
- `make format` will format the codebase.
- `make stan` will run static analysis on the codebase.

Also note that Sail is available for any other commands you might need.
- `./vendor/bin/sail artisan list`


## Things Iâ€™d Like to Add Given More Time

- `SchoolDataProvider` should have shaped return types. A few DTOs would clean this up a lot.
- Employee Permissions via Policies.
    - Maybe teachers could only view limited data for classes they aren't the primary teacher for.
- More FE features
    - View Lessons
    - Student Statuses

If I had much more time, I think the main approach I'd take would be to disconnect the frontend from Laravel and turn Laravel into an API service. Then maybe a frontend built with Next.js to complement the API.
